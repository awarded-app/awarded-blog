It is that time of the year again: in about 2-weeks, on October 14th, the winner of **[The Booker Prize 2019](https://awarded.to/books/award/The%20Booker%20Prize/2019)** will be announced. **The Booker Prize shortlist**, announced some weeks ago, shows us the contenders for the big prize of £50.000.

The Booker Prize is awarded every year to the best novel of the year, written in English and published in the UK or Ireland, October 1st, 2018 and September 30th, 2019.

Northern Irish writer [Anna Burns](https://awarded.to/books/person/16/Anna%20Burns) won last year's prize with her novel [*Milkman*](https://awarded.to/books/milkman/20). In 2019, the shortlist is dominated by female authors (4 out of 6), but the critics are pointing their fingers to a male author as the favorite: [Salman Rushdie](https://awarded.to/books/person/837/Salman%20Rushdie). 

Let's wait and see. In the meantime, go on reading and make your bets:

<!-- ### **The Testaments**, by Margaret Atwood -->
import book825 from '~/data/book-825.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book825"/>

***[The Testaments](https://awarded.to/books/the-testaments-the-handmaids-tale-2/825)*** is the sequel to [Atwood](https://awarded.to/books/person/828/Margaret%20Atwood)’s acclaimed *The Handmaid’s Tale*. She writes: “Dear Readers: Everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in.” 

People Magazine calls it “a chilling invitation no Atwood fan can resist... ***The Testaments*** reminds us of the power of truth in the face of evil”. The NY Times says it is “a fast, immersive narrative that’s as propulsive as it is melodramatic.”

<!-- ### **10 Minutes 38 Seconds In This Strange World**, by Elif Shafak -->
import book835 from '~/data/book-835.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book835"/>

***[10 Minutes 38 Seconds In This Strange World](https://awarded.to/books/10-minutes-38-seconds-in-this-strange-world/835)*** is [Elif Shafak](https://awarded.to/books/person/838/Elif%20Shafak)’s debut on The Booker Prize shortlists. The British-Turkish writer starts her book with an excellent hook: “In the first minute following her death, Tequila Leila’s consciousness began to ebb, slowly and steadily, like a tide receding from the shore. Her brain cells, having run out of blood, were now completely deprived of oxygen. But they did not shut down. Not right away…” Tequila is a sex-worker in Instanbul, murdered and dumped in a wheelie bin. This is the story of all the time she has left in this life. 

<!-- Ducks, Newburyport by Lucy Ellmann -->
import book828 from '~/data/book-828.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book828"/>

This unusual book by British author [Lucy Ellman](https://awarded.to/books/person/831/Lucy%20Ellmann) is written in the stream of consciousness narrative style. It consists of mostly a single sentence (or, more precisely, it is only punctuated into a mere eight sentences), running at about 1000 pages.

Katy Waldman, [writing for The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/can-one-sentence-capture-all-of-life), called it an encyclopedic novel, a concept popularized by Edward Mendelson, as it renders "full range of knowledge and beliefs of a national culture." Nick Major, [for The Herald](https://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/17756116.review-ducks-newburyport-lucy-ellmann/), said that he enjoyed the novel but could not tell what it was about, or decide whether "it's a masterpiece or a terrible splurge of fearful polemic and word association."


<!-- An Orchestra of Minorities by Chigozie Obioma -->
import book832 from '~/data/book-832.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book832"/>

***[An Orchestra of Minorities](https://awarded.to/books/an-orchestra-of-minorities/832)*** is the second novel of Nigerian author [Chigozie Obioma](https://awarded.to/books/person/314/Chigozie%20Obioma). It is also his [second foray](https://awarded.to/books/the-fishermen/301) into The Booker Prize shortlists. As he did in his first novel, Obioma merges African and western storytelling traditions—in this case, the tale is narrated by the young man's chi, or guardian spirit, and the story is patterned after The Odyssey—to create a dramatic, character-based novel. 

Hannah Giorgis, [writing for The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/chigozie-obiomas-orchestra-minorities-review/580738/), says that "Obioma writes with an exigent precision that makes *An Orchestra of Minorities* feel at once timely and speculative. The novel aches with Chinonso. His triumphs are rare and hard-won. Obioma compels the reader to root for him, to see the poor chicken farmer's story as an epic." Brit Bennett, for The New York Times, calls it "an ambitious and immersive tale about love and sacrifice, told by an ancient spirit. A bold new novel from an exciting young writer."


<!-- Bernardine Evaristo (UK), "Girl, Woman, Other" -->
import book829 from '~/data/book-829.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book829"/>

The latest book from Anglo-Nigerian writer [Bernardine Evaristo](https://awarded.to/books/person/832/Bernardine%20Evaristo), ***[Girl, Woman, Other](https://awarded.to/books/girl-woman-other/829)*** paints a vivid portrait of the state of post-Brexit Britain, as well as looking back to the legacy of Britain's colonial history in Africa and the Caribbean. It follows the lives and struggles of twelve very different characters. Mostly women, black and British, they tell the stories of their families, friends, and lovers, across the country and through the years.

Her shortlist-competitor [Elif Shafak](https://awarded.to/books/person/838/Elif%20Shafak) writes: "Bernardine Evaristo is one of those writers who should be read by everyone, everywhere. Her tales marry down-to-earth characters with engrossing storylines about identity and the UK of today." Sarah Ladipo Manike, writing for The New Statesman, calls it "exuberant, bursting at the seams in delightful ways... Evaristo continues to expand and enhance our literary canon. If you want to understand modern-day Britain, this is the writer to read."


<!-- Salman Rushdie (UK/India), "Quichotte" -->
import book834 from '~/data/book-834.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book834"/>

Miguel de Cervantes' classic novel Don Quixote inspired [Salman Rushdie](https://awarded.to/books/person/837/Salman%20Rushdie) in his fourteenth book, ***[Quichotte](https://awarded.to/books/quichotte/834)***. The novel is a metafiction that tells the story of an addled Indian American man who travels across America in pursuit of a celebrity television host with whom he has become obsessed.

[Writing for The Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/quichotte-by-salman-rushdie-review-rushdie-rides-again-3gsjg8dr9), Claire Lowdon gave the novel a rave review, saying, "Quichotte is one of the cleverest, most enjoyable metafictional capers this side of postmodernism" and that "we are still watching a master at work." In a mixed review, Ron Charles, [for The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/salman-rushdies-quichotte-is-a-shambling-don-quixote-for-our-deceptive-era/2019/09/03/ff7c5ae2-ce41-11e9-87fa-8501a456c003_story.html), wrote: "Rushdie's style once unfurled with hypnotic elegance, but here it's become a fire hose of brainy gags and literary allusions — tremendously clever but frequently tedious."
