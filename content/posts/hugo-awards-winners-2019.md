## Best Novel

<!-- ### **The Calculating Stars**, by Mary Robinette Kowal -->
import book122 from '~/data/book-122.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book122"/>

The American author [Mary Robinette Kowal](https://awarded.to/books/person/138/Mary%20Robinette%20Kowal) published her first novel, *[Shades of Milk and Honey](https://amzn.to/2PjBlI1)* in 2010, year in which it was nominated for the Nebula Award for best novel. She is also the proud author of *The Glamourist Histories* series, and now she’s added ***[The Calculating Stars](https://awarded.to/books/the-calculating-stars-lady-astronaut-1/122)*** to her *Lady Astronaut* series. 
 
The first installment of two announced prequels from *The Lady Astronaut from Mars*, this book is set in 1952, right where the main character begins her journey. A meteor collides with Earth, devastating a big portion of the eastern U.S seaboard. Elma York, being one of few first-class scientists in the world, quickly calculates that the climate change resulted in the catastrophe will leave Earth uninhabitable in 50 years. The only way out: colonizing first the Moon, then Mars. 
 
“For fans of “The Lady Astronaut of Mars” and newcomers alike, The Calculating Stars is a rich, enjoyable story about the end of the world and new beginnings. Full of likable characters, sly humor, and a plot that deftly interweaves end-of-the-world action with thoughtful, personal politics, The Calculating Stars is Kowal at the top of her game.” Aidan Moher, Hugo Award Winner for On the Phone with Goblins
 
“I loved this gripping and riveting story. There are so many important subjects that this book addresses, including discrimination against women, racial inequality, climate change, space travel, and mental health, to name a few.”
Roger Hyttinen, author of the Ghost Oracle series 
 
With ***[The Calculating Stars](https://awarded.to/books/the-calculating-stars-lady-astronaut-1/122)***, the latest installment of the *Lady Astronaut* series, this book is only one of 18 novels to win the Hugo, Nebula, and Locus awards for the same piece.
 
## Best Novella 

<!-- Artificial Condition, by Martha Wells  -->
import book85 from '~/data/book-85.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book85"/>

Born and raised in the US, ***[Martha Wells](https://awarded.to/books/person/94/Martha%20Wells)*** is the author of a successful body of work. Some of the most popular works include the [Raksura](https://amzn.to/32NDhwm) series, the [Ile-Rien series](https://amzn.to/2Jo0fCz), and tons of YA fantasy novels, short stories, and even essays for non-fiction anthologies.  
 
***[Artificial Condition](https://awarded.to/books/artificial-condition-the-murderbot-diaries-2/85)*** is the second delivery of the *Murderbot series*. It follows Murderbot, a security android programmed to protect humans, traveling space on its own. It’ll encounter a group of researchers and another transport android named ART. Seeing that androids are not supposed to be on their own, Murderbot must force itself to pass as human, however possible. 
 
“Murderbot doesn’t simply come off as a rebellious or sour artificial human [...] Wells eschews human-like gendered pronouns and demonstrates just how differently Murderbot sees the world.” Andrew Liptack, The Verge editor 
 
“Artificial Condition and Rogue Protocol are tight, tense, entertaining adventure stories that nonetheless have quite a lot to say about ethics, power, and personhood.” Liz Bourke, author of Sleeping with Monsters
 
With the first installment of the Murderbot series, *[All Systems Red](https://awarded.to/books/all-systems-red-the-murderbot-diaries-1/843)*, Wells earned a Hugo, a Nebula, and a spot on the New York Times bestseller list. This prompted the author to expand its universe with three more installments revolving around the adventures of the android. 
 
## Best Novelette

<!-- If at First you Don’t Succeed, Try, Try Again, by Zen Cho -->
import book88 from '~/data/book-88.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book88"/>

Zen Cho is a Malaysian lawyer based in London, where she uses her spare time to work on her fantasy writing. Among some of her most notable works, we can find *[Sorcerer to the Crown](https://amzn.to/31IVLg5)*, *[The True Queen](https://amzn.to/2pOnSxl)*, *[Spirits Abroad](https://amzn.to/2BFcIxw)*, and several pieces on short fiction that are available to read online. 
 
In ***If at First you Don’t Succeed, Try, Try Again***, we meet Byam, an unfortunate imugi who’s determined to attain a full-fledged dragon form to earn entry to the gates of heaven. Things don’t go as planned at first, but when it meets a girl, the story takes a spin. Segmented in “thousand-years” sections, this novelette does honor to its title with a moral on not giving up. 
 
“A really sweet story about how the way others see us either pulls us down or elevates us to reach wonderful accomplishments.”
Lela E. Buis, author of Moonshadows, A Collection of Short Stories
 
## Best Graphic Story
<!-- Monstress, Volume 3: Haven, by Marjorie Liu and art by Sana Takeda -->
import book96 from '~/data/book-96.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book96"/>

**[Marjorie Liu](https://awarded.to/books/person/104/Marjorie%20M.%20Liu)** is a New York Times bestselling author known for her extensive work with Marvel and independent fiction writing like *[Tiger Eye](https://amzn.to/2BKSWAM)*. She teaches comic book writing at MIT and Popular Fiction at the [Voices of Our Nation](https://vonacommunity.org/) workshop, and she’s the creator of the acclaimed *[Monstress](https://amzn.to/2pg2eBX)* comic book series. 
 
The *Monstress* comic book is set in the 1920’s Asia, in an alternate matriarchal setting where a girl is struggling to survive the aftermaths of war. [On this third volume](https://awarded.to/books/monstress-vol-3/96), we see Maika Halfwolf, the main character, beginning to unlock the mysteries of her past as she runs away from her pursuers.
 
“Monstress has gone from a simple battle between rival cultures to a scenario with potentially world-ending consequences. [...] All of this significantly increases the tension and excitement present throughout this read and is a positive step for the series.”
ComicBookWire
 
“Monstress is one of the best fantasy titles on the shelves right now. It’s especially poignant in these times when it seems our inner demons are consuming our better selves and when we value our refuge over the people who seek it.”
Stephanie Pouliotte, Rogues Portal editor 
 
The opening for the Monstress comic book, [Volume 1](https://awarded.to/books/monstress-vol-1/866), won the 2017 Hugo Awards for Best Graphic Story and spent four weeks on the New York Times best selling list.

Its winner was ***[The Books of Earthsea: The Complete Illustrated Edition](https://amzn.to/2Ni825Q)***, illustrated by Charles Vess and written by Ursula K. Le Guin.
