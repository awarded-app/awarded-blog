Hosted by Rick Gervais in LA last night, the 77th Golden Globes ceremony crowned ***[1917](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/3191/1917)*** and ***[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/1093/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood)*** as the winners of the awards for best motion picture in drama and musical/comedy, respectively. 

Both movies also went on to receive other awards: _[1917](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/3191/1917)_ got best director for **Sam Mendes**; _[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/1093/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood)_ got best screenplay for Quentin Tarantino and best supporting actor for **Brad Pitt**.

**Joaquin Phoenix**, unsurprisingly, won the prize for best actor in drama for his role in _[Joker](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/2536/joker)_. The best actor award for comedy/musical went to **Taron Egerton** for his performance as Elton John in _[Rocketman](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/1155/rocketman)_.

**Awkwafina** was awarded best actress in comedy/musical for playing Billi in _[The Farewell](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/3202/the-farewell)_. It was the first nomination of her career. Veteran **Ren√©e Zellweger** went on the win the best actress award for drama as Judy Garland in _[Judy](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/3201/judy)_.

The best actor award for comedy/musical went to **Taron Egerton** for his performance as Elton John in _[Rocketman](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/1155/rocketman)_.

As expected, **[Parasite](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/1095/parasite)** got the award for best foreign film. Writer, director and producer **Bong Joon-ho** accepted the award with one of the best lines of the night: "Once you overcome the one inch tall barrier of subtitles you will be introduced to so many more amazing films."

The biggest "loser" of the night was **Netflix**. With strong contenders for the main prizes with _[Marriage Story](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/2537/marriage-story)_, _[The Irishman](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/3192/the-irishman)_, and _[The Two Popes](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/3193/the-two-popes)_, the streaming platform/movie producer went home empty handed.
