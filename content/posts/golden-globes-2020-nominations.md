As expected, streaming services dominated the nominations in TV categories. However, Netflix also surprised many with four of its movies on the run for the best picture prize: **[The Irishman](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/3192/the-irishman)**, **[Marriage Story](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/2537/marriage-story)**, and **[The Two Popes](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/3193/the-two-popes)**, running for best drama, and **[Dolemite Is My Name](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/3194/dolemite-is-my-name)**, running for comedy/musical. 

Noah Baumbach's _[Marriage Story](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/2537/marriage-story)_ received six total nominations, including for best actor and actress for both its leads, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansoon. _[The Irishman](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/3192/the-irishman)_, Martin Scorsese's film featuring classic Hollywood stars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, follows suit with five nominations. Tarantino's **[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/1093/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood)** also gathered five nominations, while the critic's favorite **[Joker](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/2536/joker)** stayed behind with four nominations.

The Golden Globes kicked off 2020's awards season and most of its contenders are also favorites for many upcoming awards. While last year's _[Roma](https://awarded.to/movies/movie/969/roma)_ put Netflix in the film awards' radar, this year's multiple nominations promise to bring the streaming service to the limelight.
