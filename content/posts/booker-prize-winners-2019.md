In what was called "a shock announcement", the judges announced last night the winners of The Booker Prize 2019: **[Margaret Atwood](https://awarded.to/books/person/828/Margaret%20Atwood)** and **[Bernardine Evaristo](https://awarded.to/books/person/832/Bernardine%20Evaristo)**. The decision to share the award between two authors breaks the judge's own rules, set in 1993 after Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth shared the prize one year earlier. 

Peter Florence, the chair of the 2019 judges, commented how "...in the room today we talked for five hours about books we love. Two novels we cannot compromise on. They are both phenomenal books that will delight readers and will resonate for ages to come."

This it, nonetheless, a wonderful result. Two women, being one of them the first black woman to ever win the prize, makes this year's edition historical. 

Two fantastic books to add to your reading list this autumn:


<!-- ### **The Testaments**, by Margaret Atwood -->
import book825 from '~/data/book-825.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book825"/>

Judges comment: *"It is a savage and beautiful novel that speaks to us today with conviction and power. The bar is set unusually high for Atwood. She soars."*

The canadian author **[Margaret Atwood](https://awarded.to/books/person/828/Margaret%20Atwood)** wins The Booker Prize for the second time. In the year 2000, her novel The Blind Assassin won the big prize. She has been shortlisted for four further books: The Handmaid’s Tale (1986), Cat’s Eye (1989), Alias Grace (1996) and Oryx and Crake (2003). 

***[The Testaments](https://awarded.to/books/the-testaments-the-handmaids-tale-2/825)*** is the sequel to [Atwood](https://awarded.to/books/person/828/Margaret%20Atwood)’s acclaimed *The Handmaid’s Tale*. She writes: *"Dear Readers: Everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in."*


<!-- Bernardine Evaristo (UK), "Girl, Woman, Other" -->
import book829 from '~/data/book-829.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book829"/>

Judges' comment: *"A must-read about modern Britain and womanhood. This is an impressive, fierce novel about the lives of black British families, their struggles, pains, laughter, longings and loves. (...) Her style is passionate, razor-sharp, brimming with energy and humour. There is never a single moment of dullness in this book and the pace does not allow you to turn away from its momentum. The language wraps the reader by force, with the quality of oral traditions and poetry. This is a novel that deserves to be read aloud and to be performed and celebrated in all kinds of media."*

The Anglo-Nigerian writer **[Bernardine Evaristo](https://awarded.to/books/person/832/Bernardine%20Evaristo)** is the first black woman to be awarded the Booker Prize. She wins with ***[Girl, Woman, Other](https://awarded.to/books/girl-woman-other/829)***, her eighth book of fiction, which she has written alongside essays, drama and writing for BBC radio.

***[Girl, Woman, Other](https://awarded.to/books/girl-woman-other/829)*** paints a vivid portrait of the state of post-Brexit Britain, as well as looking back to the legacy of Britain's colonial history in Africa and the Caribbean. It follows the lives and struggles of twelve very different characters. Mostly women, black and British, they tell the stories of their families, friends, and lovers, across the country and through the years.
