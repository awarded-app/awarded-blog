As good readers, we are always searching for great book recommendations. **Book awards** are a great source to help you find your next book to read. 

From general book awards with several categories to niche awards showcasing award-winning books from a particular topic, the options are plenty. 

Here is a small list of my favorite book awards to keep track of.

## Pulitzer Prize

The **[Pulitzer Prize](https://www.pulitzer.org/)** is an American award given annually to achievements in newspaper, magazine and online journalism, literature, and musical composition. In total, there are 21 categories, each receiving a certificate and a cash prize of 15,000USD (and a lot of prestige!). 

The categories dedicated to literature are **Fiction**, **Poetry**, **Biography or Autobiography**, **History**, and **General Nonfiction**. One can say the Pulitzer is the world’s most prestigious literary award given to a book. 

A 19-member board selects the winners and finalists: major editors, columnists, media executives, and academic members. Its book selection is always of exceptional quality, although limited to American authors and, usually, American-related themes.

The latest winners and finalists include, among others:

<!-- ### **The Overstory**, by Richard Powers -->
import book132 from '~/data/book-132.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book132"/>

Winner of the **2019 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction**, *The Overstory* tells us the tales of nine Americans brought together by their life experiences with trees, addressing the destruction of forests. Written in two parts, each following a unique and distinct structure, it is a novel which asks “what went wrong with mankind.”

<!-- ### **The Great Believers**, by Rebecca Makkai -->
import book133 from '~/data/book-133.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book133"/>

Finalist in 2019's **Fiction** Category, Makkai’s work is “an artful novel that chronicles a mother’s search for her estranged daughter against the backdrop of the AIDS crisis, and contemplates the ripples of grief affecting generations of survivors.” (The Pulitzer Prize Board). The NY Times included it in its [2018 Best 10 Books of the Year](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/books/review/best-books.html) list, writing that “Rebecca Makkai’s *The Great Believers* is a page-turner... among the first novels to chronicle the AIDS epidemic from its initial outbreak to the present—among the first to convey the terrors and tragedies of the epidemic’s early years as well as its course and repercussions... An absorbing and emotionally riveting story about what it’s like to live during times of crisis.”

<!-- ### **Civilizing Torture: An American Tradition**, by W. Fitzhugh Brundage -->
import book137 from '~/data/book-137.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book137"/>

Finalist in the 2019's **History** category, *Civilizing Torture: An American Tradition* offers a fascinating breakdown of America’s long history with torture. As the [Library Journal](https://www.libraryjournal.com/) puts it: “Torture is a topic that many Americans might assume is a rarity in the country’s history, since it’s now banned by international law. But as the title of this book suggests, the reality is just the opposite…Essential reading for a better understanding of social and political justice”.

## The (Man) Booker Prize

[The Booker Prize](https://thebookerprizes.com/) (until 2018 known as *The Man Booker Prize*) is a British book award dedicated to the **best novel written in English and published in the UK**. Its “sister” prize, *The International Booker Prize*, awards international fiction translated to English. This makes the Booker Prize one of the most important book awards for fiction all over the world.

The prizes are given by a group of judges selected from amongst leading literary critics, writers, academics and leading public figures. Its formation changes every year and is chosen by an advisory committee. 

This is usually my go-to book award. I have rarely found a recommendation which I did not enjoy. Among 2019’s selection, you’ll find:

<!-- ### **The Testaments**, by Margaret Atwood -->
import book825 from '~/data/book-825.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book825"/>

In the **2019 Shortlist**, *The Testaments* is the sequel to Atwood’s acclaimed *The Handmaid’s Tale*. She writes: “Dear Readers: Everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in.” People Magazine calls it “a chilling invitation no Atwood fan can resist... *The Testaments* reminds us of the power of truth in the face of evil”. The NY Times says it is “a fast, immersive narrative that’s as propulsive as it is melodramatic.”

<!-- ### **10 Minutes 38 Seconds In This Strange World**, by Elif Shafak -->
import book835 from '~/data/book-835.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book835"/>

Also in the **2019 Shortlist**, Shafak’s book starts with an excellent hook: “In the first minute following her death, Tequila Leila’s consciousness began to ebb, slowly and steadily, like a tide receding from the shore. Her brain cells, having run out of blood, were now completely deprived of oxygen. But they did not shut down. Not right away…” Tequila is a sex-worker in Instanbul, murdered and dumped in a wheelie bin. This is the story of all the time she has left in this life. 

<!-- ### **My Sister**, The Serial Killer, by Oyinkan Braithwaite -->
import book827 from '~/data/book-827.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book827"/>

This one did not make the shortlist but is among other great titles in this year’s **longlist**. Braithwaite wrote a short, darkly funny, hand grenade of a novel about a Nigerian woman whose younger sister has a very inconvenient habit of killing her boyfriends. As Marie Claire puts it, “the wittiest and most fun murder party you’ve ever been invited to.”

## National Book Award

Established in 1950, the [National Book Awards](https://www.nationalbook.org/national-book-awards/) are American literary prizes administered by the [National Book Foundation](https://www.nationalbook.org/). It currently honors the best **Fiction**, **Nonfiction**, **Poetry**, **Translated Literature**, and **Young People’s Literature**, published each year.

Books are nominated by publishers and judges by a panel comprised of five judges, including writers, librarians, booksellers, and literary critics. Each year it publishes a 10-title longlist, followed by a 5-title shortlist and a winner. All finalists receive $1,000, a medal, and a citation written by the judging panel; winners get $10,000 and a bronze sculpture.

It has suffered a lot of criticism in the last years, claiming it to be “awards for insiders” and “irrelevant to average readers and of more interest to professional writers.” This prompted a re-evaluation of its processes with an intent to align itself closer to the general public interest. 

Nevertheless, there are still interesting titles to be discovered within each year’s selection:

<!-- ### **The Friend**, by Sigrid Nunez -->
import book33 from '~/data/book-33.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book33"/>

The winner of **2018's prize for Fiction**, Nunez book is a moving story of love, friendship, grief, healing, and the magical bond between a woman and her dog. The WSJ calls it “a beautiful book … a world of insight into death, grief, art, and love.” *The Friend* is both a meditation on loss and a celebration of human-canine devotion.

<!-- ### **A Lucky Man: Stories**, by Jamel Brinkley -->
import book34 from '~/data/book-34.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book34"/>

**Finalist** in **2018’s Fiction** category, this collection of nine stories tell the story of fathers and sons attempting to salvage relationships with friends and family members and confront mistakes made in the past. The New Yorker, in its review, writes that “each story is a trenchant exploration of race and class, vividly conveying the tension between social codes of masculinity and the vulnerable, volatile self.”

<!-- ### **Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth**, by Sarah Smarsh -->
import book47 from '~/data/book-47.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book47"/>

Sarah Smarsh’s **finalist** in **2018’s Nonfiction** category is an eye-opening memoir of working-class poverty in America that will deepen your understanding of how class shapes this country. NPR’s review calls it “smart, nuanced and atmospheric.” It goes on, saying that “*Heartland* deepens our understanding of the crushing ways in which class shapes possibility in this country. It’s an unsentimental tribute to the working-class people Smarsh knows — the farmers, office clerks, trash collectors, waitresses — whose labor is often invisible or disdained.”

## The Hugo Awards

If you are a science fiction fan, you undoubtedly heard about the **[Hugo Awards](http://www.thehugoawards.org/)**. It is one of the most prestigious awards given to the **best science fiction or fantasy works** and achievements of the previous years. It includes works in about 17 categories. The prizes given to books include the categories **Novel**, **Novella**, and **Novelette**. 

The awards are voted on by members of the [World Science Fiction Society](http://www.wsfs.org/) (WSFS). In the nomination phase, anyone who joined the current and/or previous year of the [World Science Fiction Convention](http://www.worldcon.org/) (or Worldcon) can cast a vote. Afterward, only members of the current Worldcon can vote on the final ballot. It is, therefore, a relatively democratic system voted by the public.

As the oldest sci-fi book awards, it has put several excellent books on the spotlight throughout history. Here are some of its latest selection:

<!-- ### **The Calculating Stars**, by Mary Robinette Kowal -->
import book122 from '~/data/book-122.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book122"/>

Winner of **2018’s Best Novel** prize, it is Kowal’s first novel. Set in the 50s after a meteorite destroys most of the Eastern Seaboard, it tells the story of Elma York as the first woman to join the International Aerospace Coalition in its attempt to reach Mars. The WSJ says Elma is “what NASA never had, a heroine with attitude.” The Verge writes that “the Lady Astronaut series might be set in an alternate past, but they’re cutting-edge SF novels that speak volumes about the present.”

<!-- ### **Space Opera**, by Catherynne M. Valente -->
import book83 from '~/data/book-83.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book83"/>

**Finalist** in **2019’s Novel** category, Valente’s book tells the story of a galactic version of the Eurovision Song Contest. The *Metagalactic Grand Prix*, an interspecies music contest, will define if humanity is allowed to join galactic civilization, rather than be declared non-sentient, and subsequently eradicated. The Verge calls it “the funniest science fiction novel I’ve read since Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”

<!-- ### **The Fifth Season**, by N.K. Jemisin -->
import book872 from '~/data/book-872.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book872"/>

Winner of the **2016’s Best Novel** prize, it is the first volume in the *Broken Earth* series (followed by the also winner *The Obelisk Gate*). It takes place on a planet with a single supercontinent called the *Stillness*. Every few centuries, its inhabitants endure what they call a “Fifth Season” of catastrophic climate change. NPR calls it “astounding... Jemisin maintains a gripping voice and an emotional core that not only carries the story through its complicated setting but sets things up for even more staggering revelations to come.”

## Edgar Awards

**[The Edgar Allan Poe Awards](http://www.theedgars.com)** (or The Edgars) honor annually the best in **mystery fiction**, **nonfiction**, **television**, **film**, and **theater**. Presented by [Mystery Writers of America](https://mysterywriters.org/) (MWA) since the 50s, it is considered the most prestigious award in the genre. 

The voting is cast by members of the MWA, which is composed of professional crime writers in the United States. Members of MWA include most significant writers of crime fiction and nonfiction, as well as screenwriters, dramatists, editors, publishers, and other professionals in the field. 

Among this year’s selection, some of my picks are:

<!-- ### **Down the River Unto the Sea**, by Walter Mosley -->
import book889 from '~/data/book-889.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book889"/>

Winner of **2019’s Best Novel** prize, it tells the story of a former NYPD cop once imprisoned for a crime he did not commit must solve two cases: that of a man wrongly condemned to die, and his own. NPR calls it “juicy,” and AP writes ““Gritty... The plot soars... Few mystery writers can examine issues of race--how it divides and binds people--as clearly and unflinchingly as Walter Mosley.”

<!-- ### **Bearskin**, by James A. McLaughlin -->
import book895 from '~/data/book-895.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book895"/>

*Bearskin* won **2019’s Best First Novel** award. It tells the story of Rice Moore, who’s taken a job as a caretaker for a remote forest preserve in Virginia, tracking wildlife and refurbishing cabins. Things turn around when he finds a bear carcass and starts an obsessive hunt to bear poachers in the area. The NYT calls it “Gruesomely gorgeous... McLaughlin writes about the natural world with a casual lyricism and un-self-conscious joy... Remarkable... The kind of writing that makes me shiver.”

<!-- ### **Tinderbox: The Untold Story of the Up Stairs Lounge Fire and the Rise of Gay Liberation**, by Robert W. Fieseler  -->
import book907 from '~/data/book-907.json'
<BookRecommendation :book="book907"/>

Winner of **2019’s prize for Best Fact Crime**, Fieseler’s book is an essential work of American civil rights history. It mesmerizingly reconstructs the 1973 fire that devastated New Orleans’ subterranean gay community. The NYT says “Fieseler handles contradictions with finesse, parsing the closet’s long shadow over gay life in New Orleans, one reason the [Up Stairs Lounge] tragedy did not catalyze the kind of outrage and activism that followed the Stonewall rebellion... The book is loving, sensitive, and diligent.”
